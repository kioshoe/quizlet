# quizlet
This piece of code turns questions saved in a csv file into a multiple choice quiz format. 
It allows students to create quick shareable study guides for each other to test their knowledge on different subjects.
At the end of the quiz, users are given the option to save the quiz for reviewing later on. 

It's currently written to accomodate multiple choice questions with 4 possible choices. This can be adapted to your needs by changing the quiz function.

Sample csv files with questions and the saved text file have been provided in the repository.
